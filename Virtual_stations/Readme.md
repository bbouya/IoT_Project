# Environemental Stations:

Using your favorite programming language you need to create a stand-alone program that represents a virtual environmental station that generates periodically a set of random values for 5 different sensors:
    1. Temperature(-50.......50) celsius
    2. Humidity (0 ............... 100%)
    3. wind direction (0 ..... 360 degree)
    4. wind intensity (0 ... 100 m / s)
    5. Rain height (0 ... 50 mm / h)
The virtual environmental station uses a unique ID (identity) to publish these random values on an MSTT channel. You need to have at least 2 such virtual stations running and publishing their values on the MQTT channel.
